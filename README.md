# Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets Visualization

## Description

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool developed in Python using the `pygame` library to visualize the association rules and frequent itemsets generated by the Apriori and Close algorithms. The tool allows users to choose different algorithms and preprocessing methods, as well as set the minimum support (MINSUP) for generating frequent itemsets.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface for selecting algorithms, preprocessing methods, and minimum support values.
- **Multiple Algorithms Supported**: Supports both Apriori and Close algorithms for generating frequent itemsets and association rules.
- **Flexible Input Methods**: Users can choose an automatic MINSUP calculation or manually input a value.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays frequent itemsets and association rules in a visually organized format.
- **Dynamic Import of Data Processing Modules**: Depending on user choices, specific data processing modules are imported and used dynamically.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pygame pygame_gui pandas
